# Land-use Legacies and Tree Species Richness Affect Short-term Resilience in Reforested Areas

## Overview
This project investigates the effects of land-use history and tree species richness on the short-term resilience of reforested areas in the world's largest refugee camp, Kutupalong, Bangladesh. The study analyzes recovery and resilience using the **Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI)**, considering factors such as previous land-use systems, tree species diversity, and local topography.

## Key Features
- **Remote Sensing Analysis:** Uses Sentinel-2 imagery and vegetation indices to assess forest recovery.
- **Resilience Assessment:** Evaluates ecosystem resilience using EVI-based indices.
- **Environmental Impact:** Investigates reforestation efforts in refugee camps to inform future restoration strategies.
- **Statistical Modeling:** Applies linear mixed models (LMMs) to assess the effects of land-use history, tree diversity, and elevation on reforestation success.

## Project Status
ðŸš¨ **Under Review** â€“ This research is currently under peer review, and associated scripts and data cannot be shared at this time. A public repository with scripts and processed data will be made available after publication.

## Files in This Repository
- **Manuscript.pdf** â€“ Research article (Under Review).
- **Figures/** â€“ Selected maps, charts, and visualizations from the study.
- **Supplementary Materials/** â€“ Additional methodological details and supporting data (when publicly available).

## Methods Summary
1. **Land-use and land cover classification:**
   - Sentinel-2 imagery was processed using machine learning (Random Forest) in **Google Earth Engine (GEE)**.
2. **Resilience Calculation:**
   - Recovery and resilience indices were computed using EVI values before, during, and after deforestation.
3. **Statistical Analysis:**
   - **Linear Mixed Models (LMMs)** were used to evaluate the effects of land-use legacies, tree species richness, and elevation on recovery and resilience.

## Key Findings
- **Reforested areas in Kutupalong are still recovering** (**resilience index: 0.64**).
- **Forest-legacy plots** with higher tree species richness showed **faster recovery** due to ecological complementarity.
- **Monospecific plantations of *Acacia auriculiformis*** in plantation-legacy plots exhibited **higher resilience** due to their growth-related traits.
- **Topography played a role**, with **lower elevations supporting higher recovery and resilience**.

## Recommendations
- **Mixed-species plantations** should be prioritized where feasible to enhance recovery.
- **Monospecific *Acacia auriculiformis* plantations** can be considered where mixed plantations are not viable.
- **Soil restoration efforts** should be implemented, particularly in disturbed areas at higher elevations.

## Future Work
- Once the manuscript is published, data and code will be shared to encourage further research.
- Potential applications include **policy recommendations for reforestation in refugee camps** and **improved land management strategies**.
