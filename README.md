# Land-use Legacies and Tree Species Richness Affect Short-term Resilience in Reforested Areas

## Overview
This project investigates the effects of land-use history and tree species richness on the short-term resilience of reforested areas in the world's largest refugee camp, Kutupalong, Bangladesh. The study analyzes recovery and resilience using the **Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI)**, considering factors such as previous land-use systems, tree species diversity, and local topography.

## Key Features
- **Remote Sensing Analysis:** Uses Sentinel-2 imagery and vegetation indices to assess forest recovery.
- **Resilience Assessment:** Evaluates ecosystem resilience using EVI-based indices.
- **Environmental Impact:** Investigates reforestation efforts in refugee camps to inform future restoration strategies.
- **Statistical Modeling:** Applies linear mixed models (LMMs) to assess the effects of land-use history, tree diversity, and elevation on reforestation success.

## Project Status
ðŸš¨ **Under Review** â€“ This research is currently under peer review, and associated scripts and data cannot be shared at this time. A public repository with scripts and processed data will be made available after publication.

## Files in This Repository
- **Manuscript.pdf** â€“ Research article (Under Review).
- **Figures/** â€“ Selected maps, charts, and visualizations from the study.
- **Supplementary Materials/** â€“ Additional methodological details and supporting data (when publicly available).

## Methods Summary
1. **Land-use and land cover classification:**
   - Sentinel-2 imagery was processed using machine learning (Random Forest) in **Google Earth Engine (GEE)**.
2. **Resilience Calculation:**
   - Recovery and resilience indices were computed using EVI values before, during, and after deforestation.
3. **Statistical Analysis:**
   - **Linear Mixed Models (LMMs)** were used to evaluate the effects of land-use legacies, tree species richness, and elevation on recovery and resilience.

## Key Findings
- **Reforested areas in Kutupalong are still recovering** (**resilience index: 0.64**).
- **Forest-legacy plots** with higher tree species richness showed **faster recovery** due to ecological complementarity.
- **Monospecific plantations of *Acacia auriculiformis*** in plantation-legacy plots exhibited **higher resilience** due to their growth-related traits.
- **Topography played a role**, with **lower elevations supporting higher recovery and resilience**.

## Recommendations
- **Mixed-species plantations** should be prioritized where feasible to enhance recovery.
- **Monospecific *Acacia auriculiformis* plantations** can be considered where mixed plantations are not viable.
- **Soil restoration efforts** should be implemented, particularly in disturbed areas at higher elevations.

## Future Work
- Once the manuscript is published, data and code will be shared to encourage further research.
- Potential applications include **policy recommendations for reforestation in refugee camps** and **improved land management strategies**.

Abstract: Forced migration has recently emerged as a deforestation driver in refugee camps, while reforestation offers a solution to restore these degraded ecosystems. The arrival of one million refugees to Kutupalong camp (southeastern Bangladesh), the world's largest refugee camp, led to significant forest losses after migrant influx, where restoration efforts were subsequently undertaken. However, the effectiveness of these reforestation efforts, and their consequences on vegetation health, remain largely unexplored. This study evaluated the recovery and resilience of reforestation by analyzing enhanced vegetation index (EVI) dynamics, considering the legacy effects of previous land-use systems (natural forest- vs. plantation-legacy plots), tree species richness, and local topography as co-factors. Reforested areas in Kutupalong showed a resilience value of 0.64, indicating that they are still in the recovery phase. Higher recovery was observed in reforested plots that were forests before migrant influx, while pre-deforestation EVI values were associated with higher resilience in plantation-legacy plots. Forest-legacy plots with higher tree species richness exhibited higher recovery probably due to complementarity benefits, driven by resource sharing among multiple tree species. Yet, monospecific plots with Acacia auriculiformis in plantation-legacy plots exhibited higher resilience, likely due to growth related traits. Additionally, undisturbed topsoil, especially in lower elevations, could further enhance recovery and resilience. Findings of this study recommend monospecific A. auriculiformis plantations where admixtures are not feasible, while considering the legacy effects of previous land-uses and implementing soil restoration strategies. These measures potentially improve vegetation health, enhance the local environment, and ultimately contribute to better living conditions to camp inhabitants.
